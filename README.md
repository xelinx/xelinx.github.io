# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

A refactor of an existing webpage to make it more accessible, and to organize and consolidate both HTML and CSS code.

The goal of refactoring an existing webpage is to practice working with HTML and CSS style sheets. In the professional world, developers will work on adding to and cleaning the pre-existing code of the company they are employed at.

In this refactor, I made it my goal to get rid of as many <div></div> tags as possible and replace it with a more appropriate tag. This streamlines and clearly defines the content of the webpage. Both making the webpage more accessible for screenreaders as well as speed up the loading time. I also made it my goal to shrink down the size of the CSS style sheet as much as I could. 

Doing this activity was very eye-opening. Even now as I write this README, I have already thought of several ideas that I could try to condense the HTML and CSS style sheets even more. (Whether the idea works or not is trial and error).

All in all, this was a bit frustrating when things didn't mesh together or go the way I wanted or thought it would, but I still had fun refactoring the code and refreshing the page to see the changes.
